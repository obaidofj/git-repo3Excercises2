# Git Kata: 3-Way Merge

## Setup

1. Run `source setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

You again live in your own branch, this time we will be doing a bit of juggling with branches, to show how lightweight branches are in git.

1. Create a branch called greeting and switch to it
> **Done**
   ---
   
2. Edit the greeting.txt to contain your favorite greeting
> **Done**
   ---
   
3. Add greeting.txt files to the staging area
> **Done**
   ---
   
4. Commit
> **Done**
   ---
   
5. Switch back to the master branch
> **Done**
   ---
   
6. Create a file README.md with information about this repository
> **Done**
   ---
   
7. Add the README.md file to staging area and make the commit
> **Done**
   ---
   
8. What is the output of `git log --oneline --graph --all`?
> **Done**
   ---
   
9. Diff the branches
> **Done**
   ---
   
10. Merge the greeting branch into master
> **Done**
   ---
   
11. What is the output of `git log --oneline --graph --all` now? Observe the extra merge commit created with the message "Merge branch 'greeting'".
> **Done**
   ---
